This project presents the development and implementation of a lightweight, AI-driven 
conversational quiz assistant that utilizes the LlamaIndex framework for intelligent 
document indexing and retrieval. The system allows users to upload academic PDF 
content, which is then parsed and transformed into a searchable index. Leveraging a large 
language model (LLM), the assistant enables users to engage in real-time natural language 
conversations, asking questions and receiving contextual answers extracted from the 
uploaded material.
